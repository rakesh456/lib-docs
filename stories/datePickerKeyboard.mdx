- By default, datepicker should support keyboard navigation.<br/>
- Keys left/right will move focus backward/forward one day, up/down will move focus back/forward one week.<br/>
- With the shift key, up/left will move focus backward one month, down/right will move focus forward one month.<br/>
- With the ctrl key, up/left will move focus backward one year, down/right will move focus forward one year.<br/>
    **Note:** In Mac we need to use Command + <br/>


- Enter should select focused date and Escape should hide displayed date picker.
